# **1. Introduction:** 
<h2>Context</h2>
The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. The link to the original dataset can be found below.

<h2>Content</h2>
It is almost impossible to understand the original dataset due to its complicated system of categories and symbols. Thus, I wrote a small Python script to convert it into a readable CSV file. Several columns are simply ignored, because in my opinion either they are not important or their descriptions are obscure. The selected attributes are:

<b>Age </b>(numeric)<br>
<b>Sex </b>(text: male, female)<br>
<b>Job </b>(numeric: 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)<br>
<b>Housing</b> (text: own, rent, or free)<br>
<b>Saving accounts</b> (text - little, moderate, quite rich, rich)<br>
<b>Checking account </b>(numeric, in DM - Deutsch Mark)<br>
<b>Credit amount</b> (numeric, in DM)<br>
<b>Duration</b> (numeric, in month)<br>
<b>Purpose</b>(text: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others<br>
<b>Risk </b> (Value target - Good or Bad Risk)<br>

# **2. Librarys:** 
- Importing Librarys
- Importing Dataset

```
#Load the librarys
import pandas as pd #To work with dataset
import numpy as np #Math library
import seaborn as sns #Graph library that use matplot in background
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #to plot some parameters in seaborn

#Importing the data
df_credit = pd.read_csv("/Users/syx/Downloads/german_credit_data.csv",index_col=0)

# **3. First Look at the data:** 
- Looking the Type of Data
- Null Numbers
- Unique values
- The first rows of our dataset


```
#Searching for Missings,type of data and also known the shape of data
print(df_credit.info())
'''

```
#Looking unique values
print(df_credit.nunique())
#Looking the data
print(df_credit.head())
'''


# **4. Some explorations:** <a id="Explorations"></a> <br>

- Starting by distribuition of column Age.
- Some Seaborn graphical
- Columns crossing


<h2>Let's start looking through target variable and their distribuition</h2>
